Student Performance Prediction Project - Summary
Project Overview
The Student Performance Prediction project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts student academic performance based on various factors. It provides personalized suggestions for improvement and visualizes results through an interactive dashboard.

Complete Plan
1. Architecture
Frontend: HTML with Bootstrap, jQuery, and Chart.js for data visualization
Backend: Python Flask server for handling API requests
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn RandomForestClassifier for performance prediction
Data Processing: Pandas for data manipulation
Communication: AJAX for frontend-backend communication
2. Core Functionality
Single Student Prediction: Allows input of individual student data for real-time performance prediction
Batch Processing: Supports Excel file upload for processing multiple students at once
Performance Categories: Classifies students into "Poor", "Average", "Good", or "Excellent" performance levels
Personalized Suggestions: Provides tailored recommendations based on predicted performance
Data Visualization: Displays performance distribution through interactive pie charts
Results Table: Shows predictions and suggestions in a sortable data table
3. Workflow
User accesses the web interface through JsConnection.html
User either inputs single student data or uploads an Excel file
Data is sent to the Flask backend via AJAX
Backend processes data and calls the machine learning model
Model predicts performance category and generates suggestions
Results are returned to frontend and displayed with visualizations
